# TTOS-Xpert

TTOS-Xpert is an advanced chatbot designed to convert natural language questions into SQL queries and retrieve relevant data from a database. This application uses the Gemini AI model to interpret user queries and generate corresponding SQL commands, making it easy for users to interact with their databases without needing to write SQL queries themselves.

## Features

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Converts English questions into SQL queries.
- **Interactive Q&A Interface**: Allows users to input questions and receive responses from their database.
- **Real-Time Responses**: Provides instant results from the database.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction.
